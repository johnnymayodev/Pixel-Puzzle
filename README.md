# Pixel Puzzle

## üìù Description

An engaging and interactive image guessing game where players are presented with a pixelated image and must guess the correct object or scene within a limited amount of time. The image will get progressively less blurry as the timer runs out.

## ‚úÖ Goals

Create a full-stack web application/game that includes the core features necessary for gameplay. We will focus on creating a smooth user experience, designing captivating pixelated images, and implementing intuitive game mechanics.

## ‚ùå Non-goals

- Advanced image recognition algorithms
- Multiplayer (versus ‚Äã‚Äãmode)
- Social media integration

## ‚ú® Features

### Priority 0

1. A function that generates levels of pixelated images from a given image
   - A Python script could be used
2. Allow the player to input their guesses
3. Give extra hints if the player is stuck
   - For example, the first letter of the word
   - The category of the object
   - Add color to the image (only if the image starts as black and white)
4. Wordle-like gamemode
   - There is a new image every day
     - We can put the date into a hash function to pick a unique new image
   - Time the player to see how quickly they can guess the image
     - If a leaderboard is implemented, the player can see how they compare to others
   - A button to copy your time for today's image and share it with others

1. Different gamemodes
   - Endless
     - Practice your image guessing skills endlessly
   - Timed
     - How many images can the player guess in 1 minute
   - Limited guesses

## üíª Engineering Details

### Tech Stack

#### Option 1 (Preferred)

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Database**: [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io/)
- **Backend**: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) with PocketBase
- **Backend**: Python for image processing

##### Pros

- All languages (and HTML) are known by the team
- PocketBase is a simple and easy-to-use realtime database
- Node.js is a popular and well-documented backend framework

##### Cons

- PocketBase is not as powerful as other databases (might not be a concern for a project of this size)

#### Option 2 (MERN)

- **Frontend**: [React](https://reactjs.org)
- **Database**: [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com)
- **Backend**: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) with [Express](https://expressjs.com)
- **Backend**: Python for image processing

##### Pros

- MongoDB is a powerful and flexible database
- React is a popular and well-documented frontend framework
- Node.js is a popular and well-documented backend framework

#### Cons

- The team is not as familiar with React and Express
- MongoDB is more complex than PocketBase and may be overkill
